## How to Install

To install themes, you need Theme Manager, available here: https://github.com/Leviathanium/NextUI-Theme-Manager

### Installing Themes

1. Click on any theme you are interested in. It will download a `.theme` pack in `.zip` format.
2. Unzip the `.theme` folder and place it in `Tools/tg5040/Theme-Manager.pak/Themes`on your SD card.
3. Open the Theme Manager app on your device and navigate to "Installed Themes"
4. Select the theme and apply it!

### Installing Components

1. Click "Browse All Themes" above
2. Navigate to a page containing the component type you'd like to browse (`.icon`, `.bg`, etc.)
3. Click the component, and it will download the component in a `.zip` format.
4. Unzip the component as a `.icon`, `.over`, etc, and place it inside its respective component folder inside `Tools/tg5040/Theme-Manager.pak/Components`.
5. Open the Theme Manager app on your device
6. Select `Components -> Component Type -> Installed`
7. Browse for you component and apply it!

You can also browse and install themes and components *directly from the Theme Manager* if you have internet access!
